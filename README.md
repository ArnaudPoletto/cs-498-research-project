# üåû Analyzing the Changes in Captured Daylight in Real-Time Videos

## üìã Project Overview

This project aims to develop new methods for analyzing changes in daylight conditions captured in real-time videos. We focus on detecting, extracting, and tracking temporal changes, motion, and luminous changes in video footage.

## üìñ Log Book

### Week 01

#### Objectives

- [x] Create a GitHub repository for the project.
- [x] Begin the project with an introductory overview.

#### Progress

I created a GitHub repository for the project and I read some papers about how to segment sky images using basic image processing techniques.

#### Challenges and Solutions

I recognized the need to accurately detect and exclude the ground before classifying the sky to ensure more precise analysis. My upcoming tasks will focus on video preprocessing and efficient ground detection.

### Week 02

#### Objectives

- [x] Work on video preprocessing.
- [x] Work on ground detection.

#### Progress

I applied Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance cloud features but noted the introduction of noise. I mitigated this with Bilateral Filtering and temporal averaging. For ground detection, traditional image processing techniques were insufficient, so I implemented a deep learning model which proved more effective.

#### Challenges and Solutions

Basic techniques like thresholding, clustering, superpixels, and edge detection were limited and did not offer optimal performance for ground detection. I decided to explore deep learning approaches, which proved to be more effective in accurately identifying and isolating ground features.
